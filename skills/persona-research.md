# Persona Research Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides a systematic framework for researching and synthesizing buyer and user personas, with a particular focus on extracting pain points, motivations, and decision factors from authentic sources. For field service management contexts, it emphasizes technician retention challenges, career development concerns, and workforce dynamics that drive purchasing decisions.

**Strategic Advantage:** By systematically gathering persona intelligence from industry forums, job postings, review sites, and professional communities, you can:

- **Discover unspoken pain points** that competitors miss in their messaging
- **Extract authentic language** that resonates with target audiences
- **Identify decision triggers** that move prospects from awareness to purchase
- **Map stakeholder hierarchies** to understand who influences and who decides
- **Surface retention drivers** that differentiate Ucora's positioning

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Source Discovery and Mapping

**Objective:** Identify rich sources of authentic persona insights before extracting data.

**Step 1.1: Map Source Categories**

Prioritize sources by authenticity and depth of insight:

| Source Type | Authenticity | Depth | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Industry Forums** | High | High | HVAC-Talk, Plumbing Zone, HVAC School |
| **Job Postings** | High | Medium | Indeed, LinkedIn, trade-specific job boards |
| **Review Sites** | Medium-High | Medium | G2, Capterra, Glassdoor |
| **Social Media Groups** | High | Medium | Facebook trade groups, LinkedIn groups |
| **Trade Publications** | Medium | High | ACHR News, Plumbing & Mechanical, SNIPS |
| **Association Resources** | Medium | High | SMACNA, PHCC, MCAA publications |
| **Podcast Transcripts** | High | High | HVAC School Podcast, Service Business Mastery |
| **Video Content** | High | Medium | YouTube trade channels, training content |

**Step 1.2: Create Source Inventory**

For each persona type, identify 5-10 primary sources:

```markdown
| Persona | Source | URL | Access Method | Update Frequency |
|---------|--------|-----|---------------|------------------|
| Technician | HVAC-Talk Forum | hvac-talk.com | Web search | Weekly |
| Technician | r/HVAC subreddit | reddit.com/r/HVAC | Web search | Daily |

```

**Step 1.3: Validate Source Relevance**

Before deep extraction, verify each source contains:
- Active participation (recent posts/reviews)
- Relevant geography (Canada, US as applicable)
- Target company size representation
- Authentic voices (not vendor-generated content)

---

### Phase 2: Pain Point Extraction

**Objective:** Systematically extract and categorize pain points from authentic sources.

**Step 2.1: Search Pattern Execution**

Use targeted search queries to surface relevant content:

**For Technician Retention Pain Points:**
```
"HVAC technicians" "quit" OR "leaving" OR "turnover"
"plumber" "career growth" OR "no future" OR "stuck"
"field service" "micromanaged" OR "no trust" OR "treated like"
"technician shortage" Canada OR Canadian
"HVAC" "can't find good techs" OR "hiring challenge"
"field tech" "frustrated with" OR "hate" OR "worst part"
"left my company because"
```

**For Technology/Tool Pain Points:**
```
"field service software" "hate" OR "frustrating" OR "worst"
[CompetitorName] "problems" OR "issues" OR "switched from"
"scheduling software" "doesn't work" OR "nightmare"
"work order" "paper" OR "manual" OR "outdated"
site:reddit.com "HVAC" "software" "recommendations"
```

**For Career/Retention Pain Points:**
```
"why I left" "HVAC" OR "plumbing" OR "trades"
"no room to grow" field service
"annual review" "worthless" OR "pointless" trades
"skill development" "ignored" technician
"training" "non-existent" mechanical contractor
```

**Step 2.2: Pain Point Categorization Framework**

Organize extracted pain points into standardized categories:

| Category | Sub-Category | Example Pain Points |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Career** | Growth visibility | "No clear path to becoming a lead" |
| **Career** | Skill recognition | "Nobody notices when I learn something new" |
| **Career** | Compensation fairness | "New hires make same as 5-year vets" |
| **Technology** | Tool frustration | "App crashes in the field constantly" |
| **Technology** | Data duplication | "Enter same info in 3 different places" |
| **Technology** | Offline limitations | "Useless without cell signal" |
| **Management** | Micromanagement | "GPS tracking feels like I'm not trusted" |
| **Management** | Communication gaps | "Office never tells us about schedule changes" |
| **Management** | Recognition | "Work 60 hours, not even a thank you" |
| **Workload** | Scheduling fairness | "Same guys get all the gravy calls" |
| **Workload** | Work-life balance | "On-call every other weekend, killing me" |
| **Workload** | Paperwork burden | "Spend an hour a day on documentation" |

**Step 2.3: Pain Point Documentation Template**

For each significant pain point extracted:

```markdown
