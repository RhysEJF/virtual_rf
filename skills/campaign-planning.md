## Methodology

### Phase 1: Campaign Objective Setting

**Objective:** Define clear, measurable campaign goals aligned with business objectives.

**Step 1.1: SMART Objective Framework**

Every campaign requires objectives that are:

| Dimension | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Specific** | What exactly will we achieve? | Generate qualified leads from Canadian mid-market mechanical contractors |
| **Measurable** | How will we measure success? | 150 MQLs with company size 20-100 technicians |
| **Achievable** | Is this realistic given resources? | Based on benchmark CPL of $150, $22,500 budget can deliver this |
| **Relevant** | Does this support business goals? | Aligns with Ucora's Canadian market expansion strategy |
| **Time-bound** | When will we achieve this? | Q2 2026 (April-June) |

**Step 1.2: Objective Hierarchy**

Define objectives at three levels:

```
CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVES HIERARCHY

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE (What the company needs)
├── Example: Establish Ucora as the technician retention solution in Canadian mid-market

MARKETING OBJECTIVE (What marketing delivers)
├── Example: Generate 450 qualified leads from target segment in 2026

CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVE (What this campaign achieves)
├── Example: Generate 150 MQLs from mechanical contractors 20-100 techs in Q2
└── Supporting: Achieve 25% awareness lift among target audience
```

**Step 1.3: Target Audience Definition**

Precisely define campaign target:

```markdown
## Campaign Target Audience

### Primary Target
- **Company Profile:** [Industry, size, geography]
- **Decision Maker:** [Title, role in purchase]
- **Current State:** [Technology, pain points, triggers]

### Secondary Target
- **Influencer Profile:** [Who influences the decision]
- **User Profile:** [Who will use the product]

### Exclusions
- [Who is explicitly NOT targeted]
- [What signals indicate poor fit]
```

---

| **Referral/Partner** | Channel partners, integrations | High conversion | $25-50 per lead |

**Step 2.2: Channel ROI Estimation Framework**

For each channel, calculate expected ROI:

```markdown
## Channel ROI Estimation: [Channel Name]

### Input Assumptions
| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Investment | $[Amount] | Campaign budget |
| Impressions (if awareness) | [Number] | Platform estimates |
| Expected CTR | [X%] | Industry benchmark |
| Expected conversion rate | [X%] | Historical or benchmark |
| Average deal size | $[Amount] | Sales data |
| Win rate from channel | [X%] | Historical or estimate |

### Funnel Calculation
| Stage | Metric | Calculation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Impressions | [Number] | Budget ÷ CPM × 1000 |
| Clicks | [Number] | Impressions × CTR |
| Leads | [Number] | Clicks × Landing page CVR |
| MQLs | [Number] | Leads × MQL rate |
| Opportunities | [Number] | MQLs × SQL rate |
| Customers | [Number] | Opportunities × Win rate |

### ROI Calculation
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Estimated revenue | [Customers × Deal size × Expected LTV factor] |
| Marketing investment | $[Amount] |
| **Expected ROI** | [(Revenue - Investment) / Investment × 100]% |
| **CPL** | $[Investment / Leads] |
| **CAC** | $[Investment / Customers] |

### Confidence Level
- [ ] High (based on historical data)
- [ ] Medium (based on benchmarks)
- [ ] Low (estimate/projection)
```

**Step 2.3: Industry-Specific Benchmarks**

Reference benchmarks for mechanical contractor B2B marketing:

| Metric | Industry Average | Top Quartile | Source |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| **Email open rate** | 18-22% | 28%+ | Trade publication benchmarks |
| **Email CTR** | 2-3% | 4%+ | Industry average |
| **Landing page CVR** | 2-4% | 6%+ | B2B SaaS benchmarks |
| **LinkedIn InMail response** | 10-15% | 25%+ | LinkedIn B2B data |
| **Trade show lead quality** | 15-20% MQL rate | 30%+ | Event industry data |
| **Webinar attendance rate** | 35-45% of registrants | 55%+ | ON24 benchmarks |
| **Content download CVR** | 20-30% | 40%+ | Gated content benchmarks |
| **Demo request CVR** | 1-2% of visitors | 3%+ | B2B SaaS benchmarks |
| **MQL to SQL rate** | 15-25% | 35%+ | Sales development benchmarks |
| **SQL to Opportunity rate** | 40-50% | 65%+ | Sales benchmarks |
| **Opportunity Win rate** | 20-30% | 40%+ | B2B software benchmarks |

**Canadian Market Adjustments:**
- Trade show CPL typically 10-15% higher than US
- LinkedIn audience size ~10% of US, may increase CPL
- Trade publication reach narrower; HPAC Magazine primary for mechanical
- MCAC and HRAI sponsorships highly valuable for credibility

---

### Phase 3: Budget Allocation

**Objective:** Allocate budget optimally across channels based on objectives and constraints.

**Step 3.1: Budget Allocation Models**

Choose allocation model based on campaign maturity:

**Model A: Funnel-Based Allocation**
Allocate based on buyer journey stages:

| Stage | Purpose | % of Budget | Typical Channels |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Awareness** | Create category/brand awareness | 20-30% | Trade publications, LinkedIn reach, podcasts |
| **Consideration** | Generate engagement with content | 30-40% | Webinars, content syndication, retargeting |
| **Decision** | Drive demo requests and trials | 30-40% | Google Search, trade shows, direct outreach |
| **Retention** | Customer marketing | 5-10% | Email nurture, community, events |

**Model B: Objective-Based Allocation**
Allocate based on primary objective:

| Primary Objective | Awareness Channels | Lead Gen Channels | Sales Channels |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Brand building** | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| **Lead generation** | 25% | 55% | 20% |
| **Sales acceleration** | 15% | 35% | 50% |
| **Market expansion** | 40% | 40% | 20% |

**Model C: Historical Performance Allocation**
If historical data exists, allocate based on past channel performance:

```
Channel allocation weight = (Channel ROI × Volume capacity) / Sum of all channel weights
```

**Step 3.2: Budget Allocation Template**

```markdown
## Campaign Budget Allocation

### Total Budget: $[Amount]
### Campaign Duration: [Timeframe]
### Primary Objective: [Objective]

### Allocation Model Used: [Funnel/Objective/Historical]

### Channel Allocation

| Channel | Budget | % of Total | Expected Leads | Expected CPL | Rationale |
|---------|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| [Channel 1] | $X | X% | X | $X | [Why this allocation] |
| [Channel 2] | $X | X% | X | $X | [Why this allocation] |
| [Channel 3] | $X | X% | X | $X | [Why this allocation] |
| **Testing Reserve** | $X | 10% | - | - | New channel experimentation |
| **Contingency** | $X | 5% | - | - | Optimization opportunities |
| **TOTAL** | $X | 100% | X | $X | |

### Allocation by Journey Stage

| Stage | Budget | Channels |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Awareness | $X (X%) | [Channels] |
| Consideration | $X (X%) | [Channels] |
| Decision | $X (X%) | [Channels] |

### Monthly Pacing

| Month | Budget | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Month 1 | $X | [Focus] | [Activities] |
| Month 2 | $X | [Focus] | [Activities] |
| Month 3 | $X | [Focus] | [Activities] |

### Reallocation Triggers
- If [Channel] CPL exceeds $X, reallocate [X%] to [Channel]
- If [Channel] performs >20% above target, increase allocation by [X%]
- Monthly review checkpoint on [Date] each month
```

**Step 3.3: Budget Optimization Constraints**

Apply these constraints to allocation:

| Constraint Type | Guideline | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Minimum channel spend** | $2,000+ per channel | Allows statistical significance |
| **Maximum single channel** | <40% of budget | Reduces concentration risk |
| **Testing allocation** | 10-15% of budget | Enables experimentation |
| **Production costs** | Budget separately | Don't conflate media and creative |
| **Agency/platform fees** | Include in channel budget | True cost visibility |

---

### Phase 4: Seasonality Planning

**Objective:** Align campaign timing with mechanical contractor industry buying patterns.

**Step 4.1: Mechanical Contractor Industry Seasonality**

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't ignore seasonality** - Mechanical contractors have distinct busy/slow seasons; timing matters more than in many B2B markets

2. **Don't underestimate trade channels** - Trade publications and associations have high credibility in this industry; don't over-index on digital

3. **Don't spread budget too thin** - Better to dominate 3 channels than be invisible on 10; minimum viable spend per channel

4. **Don't forget production costs** - Content creation, landing pages, and creative are additional costs beyond media spend

5. **Don't assume US benchmarks** - Canadian market is smaller with different dynamics; adjust expectations

6. **Don't neglect offline** - Trade shows and association events drive real pipeline in this industry

7. **Don't optimize for leads alone** - Lead quality matters more than quantity; track MQL and SQL rates

8. **Don't set and forget** - Build in optimization checkpoints; reallocate based on performance

9. **Don't ignore sales alignment** - Ensure sales team can handle lead volume and is aligned on definitions

10. **Don't launch without tracking** - Verify UTMs, pixels, and attribution before spending

## Regional Considerations: Canada

When planning campaigns for Canadian mechanical contractors:

### Canadian-Specific Channels

| Channel | Relevance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **HPAC Magazine** | Primary trade publication | Strong mechanical contractor reach |
| **Canadian Contractor Magazine** | Secondary publication | Broader contractor audience |
| **MCAC** | National association | Sponsorship and events |
| **HRAI** | HVAC/R focus | Training and certification network |
| **CMPX Trade Show** | March, Toronto | Primary Canadian HVAC event |
| **Provincial Associations** | Regional reach | SMACNA chapters, provincial groups |
| **LinkedIn** | Works well | Smaller audience but targetable |
| **Google Ads** | Works well | Lower volume than US |

### Budget Adjustments

- **Smaller audience = higher CPL**: Expect 15-25% higher CPL than US benchmarks
- **Event concentration**: Fewer trade shows mean higher per-event investment
- **Regional variation**: Ontario/BC may justify separate campaigns from Prairie provinces
- **Bilingual**: Quebec campaigns require French content (add 20-30% production cost)

### Timing Adjustments

- **Longer heating season**: Northern climate extends HVAC demand period
- **Weather variability**: Extreme cold/hot can shift buying behavior
- **Provincial differences**: Alberta oil/gas cycles affect mechanical contractor business
